# Hyprland Dots

This is my current working config for Hyprland.

## Usage:

Hyprland is a tiling Wayland compositor/WM and as such, requires some basic keybinds to 
function. The most important ones are listed below.

- Spawn a terminal - MOD + Shift + Enter
- Kill a window - MOD + Shift + Q
- Reload Sway - MOD + Shift + C
- Kill Sway - MOD + Shift + E

## Dependencies:

This currently relies on a few dependencies.

- Hyprland
- Hyprlock
- Hyprpaper
- Hypridle

- Waybar

- Wofi

- Dunst

- Kitty

- Thunar

- Pavucontrol
- NetworkManager Applet
- Blueman

- Starship
- Brightnessctl
- slurp
- grim
- wl-clipboard
- power-profiles-daemon
- otf-font-awesome
- ttf-terminus-nerd

These are mostly interchangeable, but make sure to change the corresponding binds 
in the config.
